Welcome to the BLUEWALM GitHub organization! We believe in AI assisted future. We work to make sure, that the state of the art AI will not be pushed behind the paywall of large models. 


## ðŸŒŸ Projects

* [Get Started](https://github.com/bluewalm/notebooks_pyt):  Jupyter notebooks that show how to use our neural network layers. 
* [gpt2_pyt](https://github.com/bluewalm/gpt2_pyt): An example use-case. The usage of the softplus attention layer is demonstrated on this ancient relic. 
* [llama3_pyt](https://github.com/bluewalm/llama3_pyt): An other example use-case. The usage of the softplus attention layer is demonstrated on this more modern LLM.
