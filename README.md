Welcome to the BLUEWALM GitHub organization! We believe in AI assisted future. We work to make sure, that the state of the art AI will not be pushed behind the paywall of large models. 


## ðŸŒŸ Projects

* [Get Started](https://github.com/bluewalm/notebooks_pyt):  The Jupyter notebooks that show how to use our pytorch module. 
* [DLRM_PYT](https://github.com/bluewalm/dlrm_pyt): An example use-case. A 420GB DLRM model compressed into just 1GB. It requires the full version of our pytorch module. 
* [NCF_PYT](https://github.com/bluewalm/ncf_pyt): A much smaller example use-case. It was setup to work with the full version of our pytorch module. 
* [pytorch-embeddings](https://www.bluewalm.com): The python wheel of the free, nerfed version of our pytorch module can be downloaded through our website.
